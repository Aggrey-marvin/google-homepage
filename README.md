GOOGLE-HOMEPAGE PROJECT

In this project I will be making a copy of the google-homepage like the way it appears.
So let me get right into it.

Ok I think am done with this project and below are the few things I've learnt;

1. How to move things around using css
2. How to create a proper searchbar
3. How to make good use of github, atleast the basics.
4. Editting icons got from fontawesome
5. I failed to used google material icons(though this   isn't an achievement, just wanted to keep that in mind)

<!-- The list can always be editted if any thing else comes to mind -->
